This repository created for calculate two list of nodes communicability

The purpose is to finding different walks for information passing.

Doing matrix multiplication is a massive calculation for CPU.
In this project we are using big-multiplier library in order to calculate adjacency matrix powers.
You need to give the maximum lenth of the walk.

Important: The longer walks are harder to compute.

Calling the method

``result = communicability(network, [2], [10], walk=3)``

Implementation is using networkx as graph object.

Install
===============

``pip install communicability``
